# Foreword: PlaceholderAPI is supported, however we encourage you to use our placeholders, which all
# have curly braces '{}' around them - our placeholders parse data straight from AuctionHouse to make
# sure the data displayed is correct. Also, please do not worry about color codes here. These are embeds
# sent to discord, where color codes do not work like ingame. In addition, keep in mind that you need
# to have PlaceholderAPI and the responsible expansion installed in order to use PAPI placeholders.

# Supported placeholders in all image or Icon fields:
# - {playerAvatarUrl} = The owner's flat head image.
# - {playerHead3dUrl} = The owner's tilted 3D head image.
# - {playerBodyUrl} = The owner's tilted full body image.
# - {buyerAvatarUrl} = The buyer's flat head image.
# - {buyerHead3dUrl} = The buyer's tilted 3D head image.
# - {buyerBodyUrl} = The buyer's tilted full body image.
# - {botAvatarUrl} = The bot avatar image.
# - {itemImageUrl} = The item image.
# - {loreImageUrl} = The lore image for the item containing name and enchantments.
# Footer image not showing? The footer must contain text - thanks to discord.
# Confused about fields? You can add as many as you like. Here's an example:

# Fields:
#  - "Some Text;%vault_eco_balance_fixed%;true"

# Explanation: Delete the [] and start a new line, which is 2 spaces indented below Fields.
# Start with a dash and make sure to add a space, then double quotes. Inside the double quotes,
# the plugin needs a trifecta of settings, separated with a ;  - Using a : instead will cause an
# 'index out of bounds' error. The first and second parts can be any text or just spaces,
# the last part needs to be either 'true' or 'false' - this controls whether the fields is inlined.

ShortenPrices: false
# Should prices be shortened? Example: 1000 would become 1.0k, 2500 2.5k and so on.
