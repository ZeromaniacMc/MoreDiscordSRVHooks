# Foreford: PlaceholderAPI is supported, however we encourage you to use our placeholders, which all
# have curly braces '{}' around them - our placeholders parse data straight from LiteBans to make
# sure the data displayed is correct. Also, please do not worry about color codes here. These are embeds
# sent to discord, where color codes do not work like ingame. In addition, keep in mind that you need
# to have PlaceholderAPI and the responsible expansion installed in order to use PAPI placeholders.
# The output of {duration} and {dateEnd} will by default return 'forever' if the punihment is permanent.
# If you wish to change that, please do so in your LiteBans messages.yml - we get it this straight
# from LiteBans itself, so this value will affect the output here, too!
# {receiverName} will return the UUID of the player if the player has never joined before.

# Supported placeholders in all image or Icon fields:
# - {receiverAvatarUrl} = The player's flat head image who is subject to a punishment.
# - {receiverHead3dUrl} = The player's tilted 3D head image who is subject to a punishment.
# - {receiverBodyUrl} = The player's tilted full body image who is subject to a punishment.
# - {executorAvatarUrl} = The player's flat head image who issued a punishment.
# - {executorHead3dUrl} = The player's tilted 3D head image who issued a punishment.
# - {executorBodyUrl} = The player's tilted full body image who issues a punishment.
# - {revokerAvatarUrl} = The player's flat head image who un-did a punishment.
# - {revokerHead3dUrl} = The player's tilted 3D head image who un-did a punishment.
# - {revokerBodyUrl} = The player's tilted full body image who un-did a punishment.
# - {botAvatarUrl} = The bot avatar image
# - {inventoryImageUrl} = The player's entire inventory as image who received a punishment.

# Please note that the inventory and body images are by far larger than head images,
# they will likely not fit right into the thumbnail field ;)
# Footer image not showing? The footer must contain text - thanks to discord.
# Confused about fields? You can add as many as you like. Here's an example:
