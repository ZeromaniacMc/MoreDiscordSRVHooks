# Foreword: PlaceholderAPI is supported, however we encourage you to use our placeholders, which all
# have curly braces '{}' around them - our placeholders parse data straight from the vanilla event to make
# sure the data displayed is correct. Also, please do not worry about color codes here. These are embeds
# sent to discord, where color codes do not work like ingame. In addition, keep in mind that you need
# to have PlaceholderAPI and the responsible expansion installed in order to use PAPI placeholders.

# Supported placeholders in all image or Icon fields:
# - {playerAvatarUrl} = The player's flat head image.
# - {playerHead3dUrl} = The player's tilted 3D head image.
# - {playerBodyUrl} = The player's tilted full body image.
# - {botAvatarUrl} = The bot avatar image.
# - {itemImageUrl} = The image of the item being held in the player's main hand.
# - {loreImageUrl} = The lore image of the item being held in the player's main hand.
# - {offHandItemUrl} = The image of the item being held in the player's offhand.
# - {offHandItemLoreImageUrl} = The lore image of the item being held in the player's offhand.
# - {inventoryImageUrl} = The image of the player's entire inventory.
# Footer image not showing? The footer must contain text - thanks to discord.
# Fields are dynamic! You can add as many as you like to stretch out your embed!
