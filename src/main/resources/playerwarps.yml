# Foreword: PlaceholderAPI is supported, however we encourage you to use our placeholders, which all
# have curly braces '{}' around them - our placeholders parse data straight from Player Warps to make
# sure the data displayed is correct. Also, please do not worry about color codes here. These are embeds
# sent to discord, where color codes do not work like ingame. In addition, keep in mind that you need
# to have PlaceholderAPI and the responsible expansion installed in order to use PAPI placeholders.

# Keep in mind: When a warp is created, it does not yet contain a description and can not yet have
# a rating. This is why I commented them out for warp creation. The same thing applies to the images
# for the visitor: There is no visitor on warp creation or deletion, but you knew that already ;)

# Supported placeholders in all image or Icon fields:
# - {playerAvatarUrl} = The warp owner's flat head image.
# - {playerHead3dUrl} = The warp owner's tilted 3D head image.
# - {playerBodyUrl} = The warp owner's tilted full body image.
# - {visitorAvatarUrl} = The visitor's flat head image. 
# - {visitorHead3dUrl} = The visitor's tilted 3D head image.
# - {visitorBodyUrl} = The visitor's tilted full body image.
# - {botAvatarUrl} = The bot avatar image.
# - {categoryImageUrl} = The item image of the category the warp is in.
# - {warpImageUrl} = The item image of the warp itself.
# Footer image not showing? The footer must contain text - thanks to discord.
# Fields are dynamic! You can add as many as you like to stretch out your embed!

ShortenPrices: true
# Should prices be shortened? Example: 1000 would become 1.0k, 2500 2.5k and so on.
