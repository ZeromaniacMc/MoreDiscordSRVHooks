# MoreDiscordSRVHooks - What is it?
MoreDiscordSRVHooks is a plugin for 1.19+ spigot/fork based minecraft servers.

# What does it do?
MDH is simply a plugin to fetch data and throw it another direction. Basically, it grabs data given by other
plugins, such as who started an auction, how much an item is put to sale for and how long the auction will run until it expires, 
and gives it to DiscordSRV plugin to then display that in your discord server. 

# What plugins are supported by MDH?
  - AuctionGUIPlus
  - PlayerShopGUIPlus
  - AngelChest
  - LiteBans (not bungee)
  - PlaceholderAPI
  - QuickShop (Not hikari)
  - PlayerWarps

# Is it hard to use?
No, not at all. As long as you run the latest versions of all dependencies and dependencies of dependencies, you will be just fine.
MDH is very anal about it's configs and will always try to keep configs and comments/user instructions as clear as possible.

# What does it need to run?
MDH depends on the presence of DiscordSRV and InteractiveChatDiscordSRVAddon (which has it's very own dependencies to run on top of that). 

# What's the status of the project?
You see, I started MDH while not really knowing much about java itself. I used it as medium to learn and make something cool at the same
time. However, as things happen in life, interest in maintaining it deminished after some personal occurences.
For a while, I was looking for a successor, but that never happened. So this is why I decided to make this piece of noob java trash plugin public,
in hopes someone might pick it up or shows interest in helping me maintain it - or just for contributions.
